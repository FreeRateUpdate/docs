# ADR 1: Migrating "find eligible clients" Functionality to API

## Context

As part of the upgrading of the existing web application, a new application 
that will act as an API is going to be created.

## Decision

The decision was to do as direct a port as possible of the PHP code that handles finding
eligible clients for a lead from the existing CodeIgniter-based code to an application
built with Laminas API tools, also a PHP-based framework.

The plan is to copy over the existing code consisting of models and helpers that the
`find_eligible_clients` method uses unto the new Laminas-backed application. Then,
add whatever configuration changes are required to use those models and helpers in 
the context Laminas requires.

The final step is to then further modify the code to return the response as JSON that
can be consumed by any other application that makes a GET call to this new API end point.

## Status

Accepted.

## Consequences

A straight copy-and-use is likely not possible due to internal differences in autoloading
and lazy-loading of dependencies. But once those configuration differences have been
identified and implemented, doing the same kind of copy-and-port process will be easier
on each subsequent attempt.

Part of the new work is also to move the application towards a more DDD (Domain Driven Design)
setup, along with CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Event Sourcing (to
track behaviour and all for faster auditing of lead-client interactions). If the work to
make the existing code run in an Laminas context is more complex, then that will delay
the work of refactoring code to be using DDD techniques.
